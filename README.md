# Assessment 1: Development Environment Documentation

### 1. Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based portfolio website hosted in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/raiaashish101/myportfolio.git. The purpose of this project is to practice setting up a development environment, using version control, and documenting a basic web project to align with industry standards.
<br><br>

### 2. Development Environment Setup
To build and maintain this project, the following tools and technologies were used:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – code editor (HTML5 and CSS3)
- Git – version control system
- GitHub – for cloud repository hosting
- Figma - for creating wireframe and UI design
<br><br>

#### Installation Steps:
1. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Create a GitHub account at https://github.com
4. Clone the repository:    git clone https://github.com/raiaashish101/myportfolio.git
<br><br>

### 3. Project Structure
- **Assessment1.html** - Homepage
- **1style.css** - Styling
- **Image** - A folder, collection of images used in this portfolio website.
<br><br>

### 4. Git and Github Usage
- **git init:** Start a new git repo
- **git add.:** Stage all changes
- **git commit -m "message":** Save changes with a note
- **git push:** Upload to GitHub

### 5. Website Design
The structure of the website was created using HTML, which forms the foundation of all web pages.
HTML was used to define the layout and content of the website including headers, navigation menus, hero sections,
service listings, and a work experience section. Semantic tags like < nav >, < section >, and < footer > and organized
sections help in maintaining clarity and accessibility for both developers and users.
<br><br>
CSS was used to style the HTML content, to enhance the visual presentation of the website. Custom styles were
applied to improve contrast, spacing, typography, and overall readability. External libraries such as Google Fonts
and Font Awesome were also integrated to enhance visual design and iconography, resulting in a professional and
modern user interface. Special attention was paid to accessibility principles — for example, ensuring text has high
contrast against backgrounds,
<br><br>
Together, the HTML and CSS work not just to make the site look professional, but also to ensure it’s more
inclusive and usable for everyone.

### 6. Strength and Limitation
Strengths:
- Using Git and GitHub is standard for team collaboration and version tracking.
- HTML and CSS are foundational technologies in web development and widely supported.
- Documenting the development process improves maintainability and clarity.
<br>
Limitations:
<li> HTML/CSS lacks dynamic user interactions, data storage, or real-time updates - JavaScript or backend framework are needed for that. </li>
<li> GitHub Pages is great for static hosting, but not suitable for full-stack apps. You cannot use server-side technologies like PHP, Python, or Node.js. </li>
<li> Beginners may struggle with Git's learning curve at first. </li>
<li>Responsive Design Challanges: Designing for multiple screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) can be complex.</li>
<br><br>

### 7. Conclusion
This assessment has provided hands-on experience with essential tools used in the web development industry.
From initializing a Git repo to writing and committing HTML/CSS code, and documenting the process thoroughly,
this project helps build a foundational skill set aligned with modern web standards.
